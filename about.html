        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello there! I'm Adie Segadelli, a motivated and committed second-year student at Gonzaga University. Originally from Woodinville, WA, I am pursuing a major in Business with a concentration in Marketing and a minor in Public Relations and Psychology. My aspiration is to become the CEO of sales at a company in the future. </p>
        <p>I am a lover of all things active, spontaneous, and full of heart. You can usually find me running, working out, snowboarding, or hanging with my roommates, but my favorite adventures are the spontaneous ones with my boyfriend. Traveling is another huge passion of mine—Costa Rica is my favorite place to visit, but this summer, I’m beyond excited to study abroad in Florence!</p>

            <p>I’m a total dog mom at heart—I have two adorable Yorkies, Moose and Lola, back home, and I love them to death. Family means everything to me, especially my mom—she’s truly my best friend. I’m also a proud aunt to three amazing kiddos (two girls and one boy), and honestly, being an aunt is the best thing ever!
                Sports have always been a huge part of my life. In high school, I played soccer, basketball, and track, and I loved every second of it. I was lucky enough to win a state championship in basketball, place 4th at state in both basketball and soccer, and finish 6th in the 100m dash at districts.
                Whether it’s staying active, making memories with the people I love, or embracing life’s little surprises, I’m always up for a good time!</p>
            <p>My senior year was also the hardest year of my life. I lost my dad just days before my basketball senior night, and the grief was overwhelming. But in that moment of heartbreak, my community wrapped me in love. Over 200 people showed up for me, each holding a white rose with a handwritten letter. It was the most special moment, a reminder of the incredible people I have in my corner. I’ll never forget it.

                My dad always loved the Zags, so getting into Gonzaga felt like it was meant to be. I just wish he was here to experience a little bit of it with me. </p>
