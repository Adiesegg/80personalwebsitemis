        <h2>My Collage</h2>
        <p>I chose to promote these photos on my home page to show you the people I love most in my life. On the far left are all my roommates here at Gonzaga, who have shaped a lot of my experience through college. The middle picture is my hometown best friend; this photo was actually taken at our senior photoshoot together. I will forever treasure that friendship. The far right photo is me and my boyfriend, who I met here as a freshman; he is my best friend, biggest supporter, and just the most amazing person. I can't wait to go through life with all of them!</p>
